High Performance Computing - Parallelised pattern searching.

OpenMP and MPI parallelised solutions to search for a pattern in a given text, using the straightforward algorithm.

Two search types: 
 - Find any occurrence: return -2 if found, -1 if not found
 - Find all occurrences: return all positions if patterns found, return -1 if not found
